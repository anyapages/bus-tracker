# MIT Bus Tracker ðŸšŒ

MIT bus tracker is a real-time bus tracking information that allows riders to track the exact location of a bus in real time around Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)

## Installation
API key for Google's Maps JavaScript is required for testing. Then, we need to add *mybusA.png* and *mybusB.png* markers for `function getIcon(bus)` on the map to highlight the bus routes.

## Usage 
<img src = 'example.png' width="340" height="290">
